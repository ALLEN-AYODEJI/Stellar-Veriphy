# Contract Implementation Documentation

This document explains the architecture, storage layout, cross-contract call patterns, and error handling conventions for the Stellar Veriphy smart contracts.

## Storage Key Conventions

Contracts use the `DataKey` enum to define storage keys. There are two main patterns:

1. **Simple variants**: For singleton values or simple mappings.
   ```rust
   #[contracttype]
   pub enum DataKey {
       Registry,
       Provenance,
       Admin,
   }
   ```

2. **Parameterized variants**: For mappings that require parameters (e.g., addresses, hashes).
   - Using tuple variants: `Provider(Address)` or `TeeHash(BytesN<32>)`
   - Using composite keys: In the provenance contract, tuples like `(symbol_short!("MANI"), manifest_hash)` are used for reverse lookups.

**Temporary vs Persistent Storage**:
- **Temporary storage**: Used for short-lived data with automatic expiration (TTL). Example: Oracle contract stores requests in temporary storage with a TTL of 100 ledgers.
- **Persistent storage**: Used for long-lived data (e.g., configuration, balances, certificates). No automatic expiration.

## TTL Strategy

The Oracle contract implements a TTL strategy for verification requests:
- Constant `REQUEST_TTL_LEDGERS` set to 100 ledgers.
- When storing a request in temporary storage, `extend_ttl` is called with the same value for both threshold and extension.
- This ensures requests are automatically removed after 100 ledgers if not processed.

Other contracts (Registry, Provenance) use persistent storage for their core data and do not implement explicit TTL strategies, as the data is intended to be long-lived.

## Cross-Contract Call Patterns

Contracts interact via synchronous invocations using `Env::invoke_contract` or generated client stubs.

### Oracle → Registry
The Oracle contract makes two types of calls to the Registry contract:
1. **Check TEE hash approval**:
   ```rust
   let registry: Address = env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Registry)?;
   let approved: bool = env.invoke_contract(
       &registry,
       &Symbol::new(&env, "is_tee_hash_approved"),
       vec![&env, tee_hash.into()],
   );
   ```
2. **Check provider authorization**:
   ```rust
   let provider_ok: bool = env.invoke_contract(
       &registry,
       &Symbol::new(&env, "is_provider"),
       vec![&env, provider.clone().into()],
   );
   ```

### Registry → Provenance
The Registry contract uses a generated client stub for type-safe cross-contract calls:
1. **Client definition** (in registry/src/lib.rs):
   ```rust
   mod provenance {
       use soroban_sdk::{contractclient, contracttype, Address, Bytes, Env};

       #[contractclient(name = "ProvenanceClient")]
       pub trait ProvenanceContract {
           fn mint(
               env: Env,
               storage_ref: Bytes,
               manifest_hash: Bytes,
               attestation_hash: Bytes,
               to: Address,
           ) -> u64;
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Usage**:
   ```rust
   let provenance_id: Address = env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Provenance)?;
   let client = provenance::ProvenanceClient::new(&env, &provenance_id);
   let cert_id = client.mint(&content, &empty, &empty, &owner);
   ```

## Error Enum Conventions

All contracts define errors using the `#[contracterror]` attribute on an enum:
- Derive `Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq` for pattern matching and logging.
- Error discriminants are explicitly numbered (starting from 1) to ensure stability.
- Example from Oracle contract:
  ```rust
  #[contracterror]
  #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
  pub enum Error {
      NotInitialized        = 1,
      UnauthorizedSigner    = 2,
      AlreadyInitialized    = 3,
      RegistryNotConfigured = 4,
      TeeNotVerified        = 5,
      ProviderNotRegistered = 6,
  }
  ```
- The Provenance contract returns `Result` from `get_certificate` to avoid panics for expected errors (e.g., `CertificateNotFound`).

## Event Emission Patterns

Contracts emit events using the `#[contractevent]` attribute:
- Define a struct with fields, marking topics with `#[topic]` (up to 4 topics).
- Emit using `.emit(&env)`.
- Example from Provenance contract:
  ```rust
  #[contractevent]
  pub struct CertificateMinted {
      #[topic]
      pub owner: Address,
      #[topic]
      pub certificate_id: u64,
      #[topic]
      pub manifest_hash: String,
  }
  ```
  ```rust
  CertificateMinted {
      owner: to,
      certificate_id: id,
      manifest_hash,
  }
  .emit(&env);
  ```
- The Oracle contract uses a simpler pattern for events (single topic):
  ```rust
  env.events().publish((Symbol::new(&env, "submitted"),), id);
  ```

## Certificate Management Functions

### Issue #172 - Certificate Transfer
The Provenance contract supports transferring certificate ownership:
```rust
pub fn transfer_certificate(
    env: Env,
    certificate_id: u64,
    new_owner: Address,
) -> Result<(), ProvenanceError>
```
- Only the current certificate owner can transfer
- Emits a `CertificateTransferred` event with source and destination addresses
- Transfer history is tracked via incremental counters

### Issue #173 - Certificate Metadata
Certificates can have mutable metadata (display name and description) without altering core verification data:
```rust
pub fn update_metadata(
    env: Env,
    certificate_id: u64,
    display_name: String,
    description: String,
) -> Result<(), ProvenanceError>

pub fn get_metadata(
    env: Env,
    certificate_id: u64,
) -> Result<CertificateMetadata, ProvenanceError>
```
- Only the certificate owner can update metadata
- Hash fields remain immutable
- Version history tracked automatically with `MetadataVersion` entries
- Each update increments the metadata version counter

### Issue #174 - Time-Range Certificate Queries
Retrieve certificates within a time range with pagination support:
```rust
pub fn get_certificates_by_time_range(
    env: Env,
    start_time: u64,
    end_time: u64,
    offset: u32,
    limit: u32,
) -> Vec<(u64, ProvenanceCert)>
```
- Returns results sorted chronologically (newest first)
- Supports pagination via `offset` and `limit` parameters
- Optimized for analytics and reporting use cases

### Issue #175 - Batch Certificate Minting
Mint multiple certificates in a single transaction:
```rust
pub fn mint_batch(
    env: Env,
    storage_refs: Vec<String>,
    manifest_hashes: Vec<String>,
    attestation_hashes: Vec<String>,
    to: Address,
) -> Result<Vec<u64>, ProvenanceError>
```
- Maximum batch size: 50 certificates
- Prevents duplicate manifest hashes within the batch
- Returns all minted certificate IDs
- Emits a single `BatchMinted` event containing all IDs

## Cross-Contract Call Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the typical flow for a verification request from Oracle to Registry to Provenance:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Oracle
    participant Registry
    participant Provenance

    User->>Oracle: submit_request(storage_ref, manifest_hash, requester)
    Oracle->>Registry: is_tee_hash_approved(tee_hash)
    Registry-->>Oracle: approval result
    Oracle->>Registry: is_provider(provider_key)
    Registry-->>Oracle: provider result
    alt both checks pass
        Oracle->>Provenance: mint(storage_ref, manifest_hash, attestation_hash, to)
        Provenance-->>Oracle: certificate_id
        Oracle-->>User: request ID
    else
        Oracle-->>User: error (unauthorized, invalid TEE, etc.)
    end
```

Note: The actual flow may vary based on the specific function being called (e.g., `verify_attestation` in Oracle involves both TEE and provider checks before proceeding).

Post-minting operations (transfer, metadata updates, queries, batch operations) are called directly on the Provenance contract and do not require Oracle or Registry involvement.
