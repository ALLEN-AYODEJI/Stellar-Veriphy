# ⭐ StellarVeriphy — The Truth Engine for the Stellar Ecosystem

StellarVeriphy is a decentralized digital content verification and provenance platform built on the **Stellar blockchain**. It enables creators, developers, and platforms to generate immutable authenticity proofs for digital media directly on-chain using **Soroban smart contracts** — Stellar's native smart contract platform built on Rust/WASM.

By leveraging Stellar's ultra-low transaction fees (~0.00001 XLM), fast 3–5 second finality, and energy-efficient **Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)**, StellarVeriphy makes large-scale content verification affordable, scalable, and environmentally sustainable.

## 🌐 What StellarVeriphy Solves

Digital media today can easily be manipulated, forged, or misrepresented — deepfakes, AI-generated content, tampered documents. StellarVeriphy provides a robust solution through:

- **Tamper-proof content provenance** — records the history and origin of content immutably on Stellar.
- **Cryptographic authenticity verification** — uses advanced cryptographic techniques to verify media has not been altered.
- **On-chain certification** — mints a permanent record on Stellar that acts as a "digital birth certificate" for the asset.
- **Trustless third-party verification** — external apps can verify media without relying on a central authority.
- **Secure encryption and access control** — protects sensitive media while allowing controlled sharing.
- **Developer APIs** — simplifies integration of trust verification into existing workflows.

## 🚀 Core Architecture

StellarVeriphy combines **Web2 infrastructure** (speed and storage) with **Web3 trust guarantees** (immutability and verification).

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 📂 Media Provenance Verification
- Upload images, videos, documents, or AI-generated media.
- Attach a JSON manifest describing origin metadata (creator, timestamp, device info).
- Generate immutable authenticity certificates on Stellar.

### 🔐 Encryption & Access Control (KMS)
- Encrypts media before it enters the storage layer.
- Controls decryption permissions — creators specify who can view content.
- Supports key rotation and audit trails for enterprise-grade security.

### 🧠 Trusted Off-Chain Verification (TEE Oracle)
- **AWS Nitro Enclaves** provide a highly isolated compute environment.
- **Oracle Worker Nodes** orchestrate data flow between storage and the TEE.
- **Cryptographic Attestation** — the TEE generates a signed proof that verification ran correctly.

### 📜 On-Chain Provenance Certificates (Soroban)
Each minted certificate contains:
- Storage reference ID (IPFS CID or DB ID)
- Manifest hash
- Attestation proof hash
- Timestamp and creator identity (Stellar public key)

### 🧪 Proof-as-a-Service APIs
- `POST /api/verify/submit` — submit media for verification
- `GET /api/verify/status/:jobId` — check verification status
- `POST /api/webhook` — receive real-time callbacks

## 🛠️ Smart Contracts

| Contract | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `contracts/oracle` | Handles verification request submission and state management |
| `contracts/provenance` | Mints immutable provenance certificates after TEE attestation |
| `contracts/registry` | Maintains approved TEE code hashes and trusted oracle providers |

### Manifest Schema

```json
{
  "contentHash": "sha256:...",
  "creator": "G...",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-15T17:00:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "device": "Camera Model X",
    "location": "Lat/Long",
    "aiModel": "None"
  }
}
```
